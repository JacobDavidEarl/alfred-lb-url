# Alfred Letterboxd Url Workflow

This workflow makes a url along letterboxd’s naming convention for movies from any copied text. This does not cause the page to appear, just formats the last thing you copied and outputs a url. Letterboxd movie pages all follow the same pattern, so as long as you copy the name of the movie first, this should work.

1. Write out the name of a movie
2. Cut or copy that string of text. Please just get the movie name.
3. In the place you want the url (probably the address field on a link you’re writing) type “\\lburl” or whatever you set it to. 
4. Should be good to go. 

I set it to look for the url and pop up a dialog if it returns a 404, so if the dialog shows up either say “okay” or click the search function. This should open a quick search on letterboxd with your default browser for the best version of whatever you copied most recently.

There is also included a direct link search with the same conventions outlined above, but behaving more like a regular alfred search. 
Alright, good luck.
